My glorious profile: https://www.freecodecamp.com/cthulh

All projects and "code tests" (called Bonfires) from Free Code Camp online Full Stack Course. I read somewhere that nobody ever finished their course as they got employed before they had a chance to finish it.
My goal is to finish it without getting employed. That should show them. Making claims like that...

##Repo breakdown:

1. Bonfires

  This folder will contain all my exercises aka tests aka bonfires. As I go along the course and demolish subsequent challanges, this is the place where it will get stored. Even though the chanlanges themselves are all in-browser - I do need to have a trace of what I have done don't I? (Rule #1 NEVER MISS A CHANCE FOR AN EXTRA COMMIT)

2. Portfolio [PROJECT WEBSITE](http://marius-cth.bitballoon.com/)

  This is a basic portfolio site I've built as part of the Basic Front End Dev Projects challange.

3. Tribute Page [PROJECT WEBSITE](http://jung-tribute.bitballoon.com/)

  This is a basic tribute page dedicated to Carl Jung my childchood hero I've built as part of the Basic Front End Dev Projects challange.
